## Overview

**PS2 Memory Card Reader & Editor** is a feature-rich, standalone utility engineered for Android devices to browse, manage, inspect, backup, and edit PlayStation 2 memory cards and savegames. Designed natively using **Jetpack Compose** and **Material You (Material 3)**, it offers a seamless mobile experience for emulator enthusiasts (PCSX2, ARMSX2, AetherSX2, NetherSX2) and real PS2 console owners managing saves over USB-OTG adapters or SD cards.

## Key Features

### 🗂️ Memory Card Management & Creation
- **NAND Flash Erased State (Unformatted Cards)**: Create pristine unformatted memory cards initialized to `0xFF` (erased flash state), byte-for-byte identical to cards created by PCSX2 / ARMSX2 (`FileMcd_CreateNewCard`). Eliminates write-corruption and recovery loops inside the PS2 BIOS browser and game engines.
- **Pre-formatted Cards**: Generate ready-to-use memory cards with a valid Superblock, indirect FAT allocation tables, and root directory entries.
- **Multiple Capacities**: Support for standard 8MB cards as well as extended 16MB, 32MB, 64MB, and 128MB cards with accurate cluster geometry.
- **In-App Formatting**: Format unformatted or damaged memory cards directly inside the app with a single tap.
- **ECC & RAW Conversion**: Convert on the fly between **ECC format** (528 bytes/page with 16-byte Reed-Solomon/Hamming parity spare area) and **RAW format** (512 bytes/page).
- **Folder Memory Cards**: Open and browse PCSX2 folder-type memory cards (`_pcsx2_superblock` and hierarchical directory trees).

### 🎮 Savegame Management & Tools
- **Multi-Format Archive Support**:
  - **PSU / EMS**: Import and export standard `.psu` saves compatible with EMS and PS2SaveBuilder.
  - **Action Replay MAX**: Unpack and import compressed `.max` savegame containers.
  - **CodeBreaker**: Unpack and import `.cbs` savegame archives.
  - **ZIP Archives**: Export save folders as `.zip` packages for easy backup and sharing.
- **Save File Inspection**: View full directory listings, individual file sizes, creation/modification timestamps, and copy protection flags.
- **Save Deletion & Slot Defragmentation**: Safely remove save directories with full cluster chain deallocation and parent directory slot re-indexing.

### 🎨 Visuals & Diagnostics
- **3D Save Icon Rendering**: Decodes PS2 `.icn` / `.ico` 16-bit RGB1555 texture data directly into full-color Android Bitmaps for save card thumbnails.
- **Shift-JIS & Full-Width Text Decoding**: Accurately decodes CP932 / Shift-JIS Japanese and Western game titles and subtitles stored in `icon.sys`.
- **`icon.sys` Inspector**: View 3D icon filenames, lighting direction vectors, ambient colors, and copy-protection attributes.
- **Diagnostics & Hex Viewer**:
  - Detailed card diagnostic modal showing superblock version, cluster allocation statistics, and bad block status.
  - Built-in hex viewer to inspect any raw file or sector.

### 📱 Modern Android UI
- **Material You (Material 3)**: Dynamic color theming on Android 12+ (SDK 31+) with retro PlayStation deep blue & cyan accents on Android 8–11.
- **Autobreak Layout**: Responsive `FlowRow` layouts for capacity pills and creation modes prevent horizontal overflow and clip gracefully across any screen size.
- **Scrollable Dialogs**: Designed for all screen sizes, foldables, and landscape orientations.
- **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**: Full Android SAF integration to load, edit, and export cards across internal storage, SD cards, and USB OTG drives.
